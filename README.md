## ESPC19 : Gaining SPFx Super Abilities with React, Office UI Fabric and PnP SPFx Controls

Demo Code from my presentation at ESPC 2019

### Building the code

```bash
git clone the repo
npm i
npm i -g gulp
gulp

This package produces the following:

* lib/* - intermediate-stage commonjs build artifacts
* dist/* - the bundled script, along with other resources
* deploy/* - all resources which should be uploaded to a CDN.

### Build options

gulp clean 
gulp test 
gulp serve 
gulp bundle 
gulp package-solution
